This study developed a hybrid framework integrating theoretical modeling with machine learning (ML) to forecast daily cooling loads for two monitored rooms (C1 and C3) using comprehensive environmental data collected over a full year. The dataset included hourly measurements of indoor temperature and humidity, outdoor temperature, relative humidity (RH), and wind speed. Theoretical cooling load values were calculated using heat transfer equations, serving as ground truth for model training. Two supervised ML algorithms—k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM)—were trained on calculated features to predict cooling loads. Results showed that the SVM model outperformed kNN in both rooms, achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9783 with RMSE of 117.41 kWh and CVRMSE of 5.107 % for Room C1, and an R2 of 0.9639 with RMSE of 77.13 kWh and CVRMSE of 5.851 % for Room C3. Comparative bar plots and regression analyses further validated model accuracy, revealing high alignment between predicted and theoretical values.

This review takes an in-depth look at energydemand prediction models for buildings in that it delves into recent developments in building energy approaches used to predict energy usage. By enlisting current approaches to the modelling of buildings, methods for building energy simulations can be categorized into four level classes as follows: (i) datadriven approaches; (ii) physics-based approaches; (iii) large scale building energy forecasting approaches; and (iv) hybrid approaches. The focus of this review is to target the data-driven approach and largescale building energy predicting-based approaches. Here the data driven approaches can be categorized by (1) artiﬁcial neural network based approaches; (2) clustering based approaches; (3) statistical and machine learning-based approaches; and (4) support vector machine based approaches. From there, the type of data-driven based approach is further grouped by (a) benchmarking models; (b) energy-mapping models; (c) energy forecasting models; and (d) energy proﬁling models.

Addressing this issue requires innovative solutions that can reduce both the size of the central system and overall energy use, while still maintaining thermal comfort for occupants. This study proposes a novel hybrid cooling system that combines a central cooling system with localized thermoelectric coolers. A key innovation in this research is the use of a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict real-time cooling loads based on factors such as temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and occupancy. The system was evaluated through simulations conducted for a 40-unit MURB in Toronto, Canada, over the summer months. System components included solar evacuated tube collectors, absorption chillers, phase change material storage, and thermoelectric coolers. Cooling load analysis revealed that the building operates near peak capacity for less than 10 % of the time, underscoring the potential for hybrid system optimization. A Machine Learning model was developed to control the operation of the thermoelectric coolers, achieving a high R-squared value (R2 = 0.9937) and a SMAPE of 15.87 %, ensuring accurate cooling load predictions. Results showed that both the central and hybrid systems provided acceptable thermal comfort, with PMV and PPD values within acceptable ranges. However, the hybrid system demonstrated higher energy efficiency, achieving a COP of 1.36 compared to 1.28 for the central system. These findings establish the hybrid cooling system, integrated with ML-based control, as a viable and sustainable solution for reducing energy consumption and enhancing cooling performance in residential buildings.","2025-06","2025-10-30 09:04:31","2025-10-30 09:04:31","2025-10-29 17:22:31","115613","","","336","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","Energy efficiency; hybrid models; Machine learning; Multi setpoint control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in tropical climates, Data Center operators are still found to be operating at lower temperatures. In this paper, we demonstrate that using a floating setpoint with a lowered temperature value for tropical climates reduces the overall energy consumption of Data Centers as opposed to raising the temperature in a static manner. We achieve this by applying a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to a hybrid data center model that was built from data collected off a highly efficient data center. This generates an optimal control strategy which minimizes the costs of energy consumption while operating within the required set of operational constraints. Following which, we evaluate the behavior of the control strategy to account for the exact sources of energy savings. The deep reinforcement learning algorithm learns by continually interacting with the built Data Center model without any prior knowledge of the Data Center. The algorithm is trained under the full-load and the partload configuration of the Data Center. Testing results show that further energy savings of up to 3% and 5.5% (under full load and part load respectively) can be achieved with targeted cooling provisioning while operating within constraints in an already cooling-efficient Data Center. We find that while building level optimization studies of Data Centers generally improve energy efficiency, the source of energy savings is not well accounted for.

With the help of forecasting models, building energy management systems, which are a fundamental part of smart buildings, know when sudden changes in the energy consumption pattern could occur. Currently, different forecasting methods use models that allow building energy management systems to forecast energy consumption. Due to this, it is increasingly necessary to have appropriate forecasting models to be able to maintain a balance between energy consumption and occupant comfort. The objective of this paper is to present an energy consumption forecasting strategy that allows hourly day-ahead predictions. The presented forecasting strategy is tested using real data from two buildings located in Valladolid, Spain.

For this reason, the adoption of advanced monitoring systems, based on Machine Learning (ML) and visualization techniques, is crucial to avoid possible deviations from the baseline energy consumption. However, the historical data on which analyses are based generally do not report the occurrence of anomalies. Therefore, the application of supervised ML techniques is limited and unsupervised approaches are favored. Moreover, domain experts find most Machine Learning (ML) techniques hard to interpret, and thus find it difficult to contextualize anomalies. To overcome these issues, this work proposes a machine learning-based Anomaly Detection Framework (ADF) that involves the use of two complementary semi-supervised ML applications to obtain a highly interpretable and accurate detection of anomalies. Both techniques use Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) encoding to extract the most relevant information from load profiles. The aim of the first approach is to maximize the interpretability of the definition and distinction between anomalous and normal behavior. This is achieved using a Classification And Regression Tree (CART), albeit at the expense of a coarser output granularity. The second approach exploits an Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm to obtain a higher and more accurate output resolution, although it leads to a less interpretable definition of any anomalous behavior. The ADF has been applied to a real case study using electricity consumption data provided by a large telecommunications service provider. The results show that combining both ML models enhances the accuracy and interpretability of the detected anomalies.","2023-12","2025-10-30 09:04:31","2025-10-30 09:04:31","2025-10-29 17:21:21","101194","","","36","","Sustainable Energy, Grids and Networks","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Develops a semi-supervised Anomaly Detection Framework (ADF) combining SAX-CART and SAX-MLP models for high interpretability and accuracy in detecting anomalies in electricity consumption.

In DeepEE, we first propose a PArameterized action space based Deep Q-Network (PADQN) algorithm to solve the hybrid action space problem and jointly optimize the job scheduling for the IT system and the airflow rate adjustment for the cooling system. Then, a two-time-scale control mechanism is applied in PADQN to coordinate the IT and cooling systems more accurately and efficiently.

New buildings and buildings with newly installed meters have small historical datasets that are insuﬃcient to create accurate predictions.

For this reason and to discuss recent developments in the AIbased approaches for building energy use prediction, this paper conducts an in-depth review of single AI-based methods such as multiple linear regression, artiﬁcial neural networks, and support vector regression, and ensemble prediction method that, by combining multiple single AI-based prediction models improves the prediction accuracy manifold. This paper elaborates the principles, applications, advantages and limitations of these AI-based prediction methods and concludes with a discussion on the future directions of the research on AI-based methods for building energy use prediction.","2017-08","2025-10-30 09:04:31","2025-10-30 09:04:31","2025-10-29 19:52:52","796-808","","","75","","Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","A review of artificial intelligence based building energy use prediction","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","artificial neural network; hybrid models; predictive control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system within each MUB is often shared or partially-shared between datacenter rooms and office zones, for removing the heat generated by computing equipment and maintaining desired room temperature for building tenants. To effectively reduce the total energy cost of MUBs, it is important to leverage the scheduling flexibility in both the HVAC system and the datacenter workload. In this work, we formulate both HVAC control and datacenter workload scheduling as a Markov decision process (MDP), and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm for minimizing the total energy cost while maintaining desired room temperature and meeting datacenter workload deadline constraints. Moreover, we also develop a heuristic DRL-based algorithm to enable interactive workload allocation among geographically distributed MUBs for further energy reduction. The experiment results demonstrate that our regular DRL-based algorithm can achieve up to 26.9 percent cost reduction for a single MUB, when compared with a baseline strategy.

This study proposes an approximate MPC that mimics the dynamic behaviours of MPC using the recurrent neural network with a structure of nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs. The approximate MPC is developed by learning from the measured operation data of buildings controlled by MPC, therefore it can produce MPC-like control for buildings without needing to solve the optimization problem, significantly reducing the computation load as compared to MPC. The proposed approximate MPC is implemented in two testbeds, an office and a lecture theatre, to control the air-conditioning systems. The control performance of the approximate MPC is compared to MPC as well as the original reactive control of the two testbeds. The approximate MPC retained most of the energy and thermal comfort performance of MPC in both testbeds. For the office, the MPC and approximate MPC reduced 58.5% and 51.6% of cooling energy consumption, respectively, as compared to the original control. For the lecture theatre, the MPC and approximate MPC reduced 36.7% and 36.2% of cooling energy consumption, respectively, as compared to the original control.

In a typical DC, around 30~40% of the energy is spent on the cooling system rather than on computer servers, posing a pressing need for developing new energy-saving optimization technologies for DC cooling systems. However, optimizing such real-world industrial systems faces numerous challenges, including but not limited to a lack of reliable simulation environments, limited historical data, and stringent safety and control robustness requirements. In this work, we present a novel physics-informed offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework for energy efficiency optimization of DC cooling systems. The proposed framework models the complex dynamical patterns and physical dependencies inside a server room using a purposely designed graph neural network architecture that is compliant with the fundamental time-reversal symmetry. Because of its well-behaved and generalizable state-action representations, the model enables sample-efficient and robust latent space offline policy learning using limited real-world operational data. Our framework has been successfully deployed and verified in a large-scale production DC for closed-loop control of its air-cooling units (ACUs). We conducted a total of 2000 hours of short and long-term experiments in the production DC environment. The results show that our method achieves 14~21% energy savings in the DC cooling system, without any violation of the safety or operational constraints.

The absence of an effective operational control strategy in the data center cooling process results in high energy consumption and poor power usage effectiveness (PUE) of the data center. This study proposes a model predictive control (MPC) strategy considering the constraint of whole system energy conservation for a multi-chiller system in a data center. This strategy aims to maintain the data center server room temperature stable in the IT equipment working environment, and at the same time, the energy consumption of the cooling system is significantly reduced, thus the PUE of the data center is lowered. The long and short-term memory (LSTM) neural network prediction models for data center cooling load and server room temperature were constructed using the mechanism-coupled data law method. The MPC algorithmic structure coupled with cooling load prediction model and server room temperature prediction model. It takes the balance between supply and demand of cooling capacity as a constraint. The cost function of multi-chiller system control considers the temperature-controlling error in the server room and the power consumption of the chilledwater system. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to solve the optimal configuration strategy of the chilled water flow rate and the water supply temperature of each chiller, which realizes the dynamic control of the chilled-water system. A dynamic regulation model was developed for a data center in North China. TRNSYS was utilized for verification based on the actual measured data and relevant meteorological parameters of the case building. Compared with the operation results of the data center cooling system with proportional integral derivative (PID) control and fuzzy control. The results show that under MPC strategy, the stability of the server room temperature has improved by 27.77% compared to PID control and by 18.08% compared to fuzzy control, demonstrating the superiority of MPC in temperature stability control in the server room. In terms of chilled-water system energy consumption, compared to the PID control and fuzzy control strategies, the MPC strategy has achieved energy savings of 11.81% and 7.58%, respectively, showing significant energy-saving effects.","2024-12","2025-10-30 09:04:31","2025-10-30 09:04:31","2025-10-29 17:27:55","114919","","","324","","Energy and Buildings","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Proposes an MPC strategy for multi-chiller data center systems, coupling <strong>LSTM-based load and temperature prediction models</strong> with a <strong>particle swarm optimization (PSO)</strong> solver.

Unlike enclosed cold or hot aisles, the conventional open room-level cooling system with underfloor air supply experiences significant mixing of cold and hot air. The lack of effective zone-specific control frequently results in overcooling in some zones and undercooling in others, leading to temperature imbalances and substantial energy waste. This research introduces a cooling supply allocation model predictive control (CSA-MPC) strategy of computer room air conditioning (CRAC) systems considering multi-zone thermal coupling effects. The strategy aims to provide precise, demand-based cooling to each zone while ensuring uniform thermal distribution throughout the data center. By integrating the attention mechanism algorithm, a generalized server room temperature prediction model was developed, enabling accurate multi-zone temperature forecasting. The CSA-MPC strategy employs a particle swarm optimization algorithm to iteratively adjust the supply air volume and temperature of each CRAC unit, facilitating dynamic multi-zone control. Software simulation combined with field measurements was employed to analyze the effects of temperature control and cooling allocation under both the CSA-MPC and Baseline strategies. Results showed that the CSA-MPC strategy reduced the maximum inter-zone temperature difference by 6.03℃, maintaining all zones within a range of 28 ± 0.5℃.
