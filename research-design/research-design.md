# Research Design

## Problem + Knowledge Gap
Cooling systems often waste energy because of poor design and control. This causes higher electricity costs and unnecessary energy use.

## Purpose
Develop and evaluate data-driven methods for forecasting cooling energy demand and simulating control strategies.

## Research Questions / Hypotheses
1. How accurately can cooling energy consumption be forecasted using environmental and operational data?  
2. How can model-based insights help detect overuse in real-world operations?  
3. What potential energy and cost savings can be achieved through simulated operational improvements?

### H1
Implementing predictive modelling and simulation-based operational strategies can significantly reduce energy consumption in cooling systems without compromising indoor temperature requirements.

## Literature / Level of Empirical Knowledge
Existing research supports time-series models (ARIMA) and prescriptive analytics; few studies focus on strict setpoints, 24/7 systems.

## Conceptual / Theoretical Framework
Linkage of environmental and system data to energy predictions, enabling rule-driven control that reduces energy overuse during specific weather or load conditions.

## Data Analysis
Forecasting accuracy will be evaluated. Energy-saving simulations will be compared against baseline using desired control rules, anomaly detection.

## Data Collection
Historical operational and environmental data as cooling energy, indoor/outdoor temperature, system status at hourly intervals from monitoring systems in central offices.

## Overall Approach
Quantitative simulation using real data to build predictive model and prescriptive model.
