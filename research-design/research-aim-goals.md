## Research Topic:
Optimization of Cooling Energy Consumption Based on Data and Predictive Modeling. Operational Analysis

## Research Problem:
Technical facilities cooling systems often work around the clock at fixed temperatures, which makes it possible to consume more energy than is necessary, especially during periods of low loads or good weather. Available monitoring data should be used for energy demand forecasting, ineffectiveness detection, and the design of practical control strategies to cut expenses.

## Research Object:
Cooling Systems in Essential Technical Infrastructure

## Research Subject:
Applying the use of predictive analytics and operational control simulations to improve the energy efficiency of the cooling system by forecasting the load, identifying anomalies, and testing optimal usage patterns.

## Research Questions:
1. How accurately can cooling energy consumption be forecasted using environmental and operational data?

2. How can model-based insights help detect inefficiencies or overuse in real-world operations?

3. What potential energy and cost savings can be achieved through simulated operational improvements without altering temperature setpoints?


4. Conceptual Framework
The framework links environmental and system data to energy predictions, enabling rule-based control simulations that reduce overuse under specific weather or load conditions.

Primary Hypothesis
H1: Implementing predictive modeling and simulation-based operational strategies can significantly reduce energy consumption in cooling systems without compromising indoor temperature requirements.​

Secondary Hypotheses
H2: Cooling energy consumption can be accurately forecasted using historical environmental and operational data.​

H3: Model-based insights can effectively identify periods of energy overuse or inefficiencies in cooling system operations.​

H4: Simulated operational improvements, such as equipment scheduling or load shifting, can achieve measurable energy and cost savings without altering fixed temperature setpoints.

5. Literature Review
Existing research supports using time-series models (e.g., ARIMA, ML) and prescriptive analytics for HVAC energy savings, but few studies focus on fixed-setpoint, 24/7 systems in infrastructure settings.

6. Overall Approach
A quantitative, simulation-based approach using real data to build predictive models and evaluate operational strategies for energy efficiency, without changing core system parameters.

7. Data Collection
Historical data on cooling energy, indoor/outdoor temperature, and system status will be collected at hourly intervals from monitoring systems; external weather data will be matched if needed.

8. Data Analysis
Forecasting accuracy will be evaluated (RMSE, MAE), and energy-saving simulations will be compared against baseline using predefined control rules; anomaly detection methods may also be used.

9. Conclusions
The study will demonstrate how predictive and prescriptive techniques can improve cooling efficiency, offering practical value and a scalable method for similar infrastructure systems.
