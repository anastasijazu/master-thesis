## Research Topic:
Optimization of Cooling Energy Consumption Based on Data and Predictive Modeling. Operational Analysis

## Research Problem:
Technical facilities cooling systems often work around the clock at fixed temperatures, which makes it possible to consume more energy than is necessary, especially during periods of low loads or good weather. Available monitoring data should be used for energy demand forecasting, ineffectiveness detection, and the design of practical control strategies to cut expenses.

## Research Object:
Cooling Systems in Essential Technical Infrastructure

## Research Subject:
Applying the use of predictive analytics and operational control simulations to improve the energy efficiency of the cooling system by forecasting the load, identifying anomalies, and testing optimal usage patterns.

## Research Questions:
How can cooling energy use be accurately predicted using historical environmental and system operation data?
How to detect energy overuse or inefficiency in normal operations using model-based insights?
You might be wondering about the cost saving potential of data-driven operational improvements such as scheduling or load shifting without changing temperature setpoints.
