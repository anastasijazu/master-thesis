## Questions

1. **What question am I asking?**  
   _Answer:_  
   How can I use data analysis to make cooling systems in telecom central offices use less energy and work more efficiently?

2. **What problem am I solving?**  
   _Answer:_  
   Cooling systems often waste energy because they aren’t working efficiently or were not designed well. This causes higher electricity costs and unnecessary energy use.

3. **What do we aim to achieve?**  
   _Answer:_  
   We want to lower energy use and improve how well cooling systems work by analyzing real data. This will potentially reduce costs, reduce environmental impact, and make the systems more reliable.

4. **Does it make sense?**  
   _Answer:_  
   Yes. There’s a lot of energy data available now from smart sensors and systems. Using data mining and analysis is a logical approach to solve this problem. It also supports global goals to use energy more responsibly.

5. **Am I missing something important?**  
   _Answer:_  
   Possibly. It’s important to think about outside temperature, how old the equipment is, and how the cooling system is built. Also, there is a need to make sure the data is correct and follow any rules about privacy or data use.

6. **How do I want to achieve the goal?**  
   _Answer:_  
   I plan to collect and clean real energy data,  explore it performing exploratory data analysis to find patterns, and applying statistical or machine learning models to spot problems, predict usage, and suggest ways to improve system performance.

7. **What is the solution?**  
   _Answer:_  
   The solution is to add smart data analysis on top of the existing system. This includes finding useful patterns in the data, spotting where energy is being wasted, and predicting system behavior — helping engineers make better decisions.

8. **How to validate the results?**  
   _Answer:_  
   I’ll check the results by comparing them to past data, running simulations, or testing them in real situations. I’ll also use accuracy measures (like MAE or RMSE, to be researched and examined) to see how well the models predict real outcomes.
